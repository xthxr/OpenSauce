## 🚀 How to Contribute

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OpenSauce.git
   cd OpenSauce
   ```
3. **Choose a language folder** you want to contribute to
4. **Create your DSA implementation**:
   - Follow the naming conventions specified in each language's README
   - Organize code by topic (arrays, trees, graphs, sorting, etc.)
   - Include comments explaining your algorithm
   - Add time and space complexity analysis
5. **Create a new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-algorithm-name
   ```
6. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add [algorithm-name] in [language]"
   ```
7. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin add-algorithm-name
   ```
8. **Create a Pull Request** from your fork to this repository

## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### What to Contribute
- ✅ Data structure implementations (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.)
- ✅ Algorithm implementations (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.)
- ✅ Well-documented code with complexity analysis
- ✅ Test cases or example usage

### Code Quality
- Include clear comments explaining the logic
- Add time and space complexity in comments
- Follow the coding conventions of the language
- Provide example usage or test cases
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### What NOT to Contribute
- ❌ Duplicate implementations (check existing code first)
- ❌ Poorly documented code
- ❌ Copied code without understanding
- ❌ Unrelated files or spam

## 🏷️ Topics to Contribute
